# Junket

Junket is a tasty dessert made from cultured milk, and also an implementation of the [Bukkit API](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit) for JavaScript using [doppio](https://github.com/plasma-umass/doppio).

Note: this project is very incomplete - at this point it mostly consists of stubs. Plugins can load, but that's about it.
